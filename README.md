# Self Driving Car Using Raspberry-PI

This is a basic project created by the VDHARV team on self driving car. We have used following techniques for creating this:

* Thresholding - to detect the track and ignore rest of the regions 
* Warping - to change the perspective of the image so that only require area in bird eye's view can be examined 
* Pixel Summation - to detect the curve values

All the modules are mostly based on OpenCV and numpy. To run the program run the main.py file on your Rasberry PI.
